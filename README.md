## 📘 What is Scanned-PDF-to-Vector?

Scanned-PDF-to-Vector is a simple tool designed to fix scanned PDFs from old books, papers, or textbooks. It helps you turn those blurry and hard-to-use scans into neat, easy-to-read PDFs. These new PDFs let you search text, copy words, and keep all the math formulas looking right.

This tool works with output from another program called MinerU. It takes MinerU’s data and rebuilds the document into a file that is clear, sharp, and easy to work with.

No programming skills needed. Anyone can use this tool to improve scanned documents for reading or printing.
