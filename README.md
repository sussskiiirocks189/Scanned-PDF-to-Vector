# 📄 Scanned-PDF-to-Vector

> **Revive your old books and papers.**
> A powerful post-processing tool for [MinerU](https://github.com/opendatalab/MinerU) to convert scanned PDFs into **Searchable, Copyable, and Vectorized** PDFs with perfect layout.



## ⚡ Why this tool?

Do you struggle with scanned textbooks or old papers?
* 📚 **Blurry text** that is hard to read.
* 🔍 **Unsearchable** content (cannot use `Ctrl+F`).
* 📝 **Unselectable** text (cannot use translation plugins or copy-paste).
* 🧮 **Broken Math**: OCR tools often mess up complex mathematical formulas.

**Scanned-PDF-to-Vector** solves these problems. It takes the raw JSON output from MinerU and reconstructs it into a **beautifully formatted, fully vector-based** HTML/PDF.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ **Smart LaTeX Repair**: Automatically detects and fixes broken inline math formulas using heuristic regex algorithms.
- ✅ **Highly Customizable**: Supports custom paper sizes, margins, fonts, and font sizes to fit your specific reading or printing needs.
- ✅ **Vectorized Output**: Converts raster images of text into real text and MathJax SVG formulas, allowing for infinite zoom clarity.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites
This tool relies on the parsing capabilities of **[MinerU (PDF-Extract-Kit)](https://github.com/opendatalab/MinerU)**.
First, use MinerU to parse your PDF and obtain the **JSON result**.

### 2. Installation & Usage
No complex dependencies required. This tool runs on standard Python libraries.

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/Scanned-PDF-to-Vector.git](https://github.com/your-username/Scanned-PDF-to-Vector.git)
cd Scanned-PDF-to-Vector

# 2. Prepare your data
# Place the JSON file generated by MinerU into this directory.
# Rename it to 'model.json' (or update the INPUT_FILE variable in the script).

# Directory structure:
# ├── convert.py
# └── model.json  <-- Your input data

# 3. Run the script
python convert.py
```

### 3. Generate PDF
The script will generate a book_output.html file. Open this file in Chrome, Edge, or Safari and press Ctrl+P (Print).

⚠️ Print Settings are Crucial:

  * Destination: Save as PDF.
  
  * Paper Size: Custom (Must match the PAGE_WIDTH and height configured in the script).
  
  * Margins: Watever.
  
  * Background Graphics: Checked (Required for correct formula background rendering).
  
  * Headers and Footers: Unchecked (The script generates its own page numbers).



## ⚙️ Configuration
You can customize the layout by modifying the configuration section at the top of convert.py


## 🤝 Credits
